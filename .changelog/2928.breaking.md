Change staking account ids/addresses to truncated hash of the public key

Previously, staking account identifiers were called ids and were represented
by a corresponding entity's public key.

Now, they are called addresses and are represented by a truncated hash of a
corresponding entity's public key, prefixed by a 1 byte address version.

Furthermore, the new staking account addresses use the newly added Bech32
encoding for text serialization with `oasis` as their human readable part
(HRP) prefix.
