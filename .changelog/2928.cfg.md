Change staking account ids/addresses to truncated hash of the public key

Due to this breaking change described above, the following configuration
changes are needed:

- In `oasis-node staking account info` CLI, the `--stake.account.id`
  option has been renamed to `--stake.account.address` and now accepts a
  Bech32 encoded account address.
- In `oasis-node staking account gen_transfer` CLI, the
  `--stake.transfer.destination` option now accepts a Bech32 encoded account
  address.
- In `oasis-node staking account gen_escrow` and
  `oasis-node staking account gen_reclaim_escrow` CLI, the
  `--stake.escrow.account` option now accepts a Bech32 encoded account
  address.
